GIT COMMANDS (personal use)--

1. first - enter your username and email in the cmd using commands 
	- git config --global user.name "xyz"
	- git config --global user.email abc@lmn.com

2. Got to the folder you want to commit and frst type the command "git init", using this command you have created a local repo.

3. to make a connection between your local and remote repo use the following command -
	- git remote add origin https://github.com/your_user_name/repo_name

(NOTE: to make this command work you first have to create a repo in your github account where you want to save your commits)

4. Add a file to your local repo. Now if tou want to add this file to your remote repo, i.e. github account, following the commands --
	-to create master branch   -- "git branch -M main"
	-to modify the file 	   -- "git add ." (to add all files in your local repo) or
				   -- "git add filename.extension" (to add a specific file)
	-to stage you file/s 	   -- "git commit -m "message to be displayed"
	-finally, commit 	   -- "git push -u origin main"

(NOTE: you make any changes in your local repo you will have to follow the commands of pt 4 again, the changes will not be automatically made)

5. Create a new branch in your remote repo using cmd - 
	- git checkout -b temp
	here - checkout -- changing the branch from main to new branch
		 - -b       -- create a new branch
		 - temp     -- name of the new branch

6. Changes made to the temp branch wont reflect to the main branch branch, unless you make it do so, using cmd -
	- first go to you main branch                            -- "git checkout main" 
	( here -b is not added because we are not creating a new branch, we are going to an exsiting one.)
	- merge the content of temp branch in main branch        -- "git merge temp"

7. To pull a remote repo to your local device -
	- 1. get to the parent folder of your local repo using cmd "cd .."
	- 2. Open github, click the green colored "CODE" btn, and copy the https url.
	- 3. write the following command to download the remote repo and make changes to it in your local device, although these changes will not be auotmatically be represented in your remote repo. -
		-- "git clone YOUR_HTTPS_URL"

THIS IS IT, A BASIC INTRO TO THE GIT AND GITHUB (from freecodecamp).
